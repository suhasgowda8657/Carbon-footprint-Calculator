# Carbon-footprint-Calculator
We are working on a web-based application, carbon footprint calculator 
Which basically collect the information from the database and calculates
the total amount of carbon emitted by the country while producing
electricity.



The idea is about creating a web-based application that backs environmental conservation.
A Carbon foot prints is the total amount of greenhouse gases(including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by human actions. 
Carbon foot print calculator is used to calculate the total amount of carbon entering to the environment.
This calculator is for anyone using electricity, who wants to know how much carbon footprint they produce, and eliminate it (by presenting the output equivalent to trees planted). This is called offsetting the carbon footprint.
Of course, electricity is just a fraction of our total carbon footprint. But if you consume a lot of it, you might want to do something.
